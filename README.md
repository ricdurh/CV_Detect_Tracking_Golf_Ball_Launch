# CV Detection and Tracking of Golf Ball from Smartphone Videos
The objective of this project is to use computer vision techniques on slow-motion smartphone golf videos to emulate launch monitor statistics.  The project is still a work in progress

High-end launch monitors use radar technology or high-speed cameras to track the movement of the golf ball and club, measuring parameters like launch angle, ball speed, spin rate, and clubhead speed. These tools have revolutionized training and golf club fittings by offering players insights that can refine their technique and strategy, as well as match the appropriate equipment to their swings. However, these tools come at a significant cost, often out of reach for the average golfer. The entry-level launch monitors with roughly 98% accuracy are typically over [$300](https://topshelfgolf.com/collections/golf-launch-monitors), while the most accurate high-end launch monitors, like the Trackman or GCQuad, are closer to [$20,000](https://topshelfgolf.com/collections/golf-launch-monitors).


This utilizes object detection and tracking techniques to track the golf ball and club movements throughout the video.
